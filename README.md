# Pasta-for-Spotify
A material design Spotify client for Android.

## About

Pasta for Spotify is a material design Spotify client for android that attempts to create a better user experience using the Spotify Web API. It has almost all the features of the official app, though playlists cannot be downloaded because that could potentially create a way for users to export songs from the app, and I'm sure Spotify would not like that.

#### Features
- Shows newly released albums and featured playlists
- A favorites section for playlists, albums, songs, and artists
- Search through all of Spotify's database
- View different categories of music
- Dynamic backgrounds that adapt to the album art
- A light/dark theme in the settings menu
- Options to change the global color scheme of the app
- Change the ordering of songs in playlists and albums
